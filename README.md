# ASD-Project-Reporting-App
A web app made for anonymous and logged-in users to report incidents at UVA. Uses Google login, Heroku, and Amazon Storage. 

This app was made as a group project for Advanced Software Development (CS 3240). On the team, I was scrum master, meaning I was in charge of monitoring progress on each sprint, organizing team meetings and goals, and communicating with team members and course staff about our progress each week. 

This app was made as an improvement to the University of Virginia's "anonymous" reporting website, which actually doesn't allow users to maintain anonymity when submitting reports of incidents. Our applicaiton allows for users to report anonymously or sign in with Google to submit reports. Logged in users can view their past reports. Our application also supports an admin interface, which allows admin to view, resolve, and add comments to reports. 

In this project, I worked mostly on creating models for our data, creating the admin interface, and connecting our views to the data tables.
